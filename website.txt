Project Name:
Frameworks & Intro to JS Project / Recreate Your Favorite Website Using Bootstrap and Javascript
Description:
This is a recreation of the Dolls Kill website which has a edgy yet girlie look that is consistent throughout the whole website, I really like it mainly beacuse of how original they're website is for example they have an amazing hero section with a video playing as the imagery.
Website Feautures:
- A reponsive navbar with bootstrap components to create a navbar toggler thats always appearent with 3 links , the background color is black with the text being white colored.
- A homepage with a huge hero section with an image to emulate the dolls kill vibe and a heading.
- A contact form section with two input types one being name and the other email with bootstrap components I was able to make a button match the theme.
- A table with information about restocking items with bootstrap I made the table stripped and hoverable and centered.
- Cards components to display the products using bootstrap to  make all three columns stand side by side in median and larger screens.
- A carousel with the hero image since dolls kill has such an edgy yet girlie feel about it for the hero image of my website I also wanted to included a darker image as well.
- An accordions for questions since the website has to do with clothing I thought theyre should be a section for those who have questions as they're shopping.
